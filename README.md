## Project started on Tuesday, 1st October 2024

## Requirements (as of 7th October 2024)
  * A portfolio with a very subtle cool Japanese aesthetic: remember target audience (corporate companies)
  Actually, about previous point: Have a link to the Japanese fun site at the bottom
  * It has to wow me yet not too much on the eyes

## Inspirational portfolio sites

## Tips 
 * Resume button should be a google drive link; not a download button
## 7th October 2024
  * Version 001 is scrapped; not visually appealing
  * Version 002 is a go; need more inspiration though
